<!-- excerpt-start -->
As a course instructor of python, when the course arrives to the end is usual that some students ask me about extra resources to further develop their skill in python<!-- excerpt-end -->,if possible in relation with bioinformatics. That's logic as [I teach python for bioinformatics](/bio) (beginner/entry level).

As the question is recurrent I have collect some reference during the last years that I found interesting and useful. I have categorized them as purely python , bionformatics & genomics and a mix of python and bionformatics & genomics as well as other related resources. These courses are free or almost free. With almost free I mean courses from Udemy that regularly have discounts and can be get for 10-15$ or even some Coursera specialization that  can be get for around 50$.

**Purely python**

[Udemy Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)

[Udemy Python Programming tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-programming-tutorial-a-z/)

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)

[Kaggle Python tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)


**Bionformatics & Genomics**

[Coursera bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics#courses)

[Coursera genomics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-genomics)

[Coursera Dna sequencing](https://es.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing)

[BIOL311](https://github.com/bioinf-biotec/labs_bioinf). This one is in spanish.


**Python + Bionformatics & Genomics + Related resources**

[Harvard informatics](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/learning-bioinformatics-at-home). Here there is a collection of diverse bioinformatics resources, related to python, statistics or RNA-seq among others.

[Sebastian Schmeier collection](https://github.com/sschmeier/elearningcollection#1-general-computationstatisticsbiology). Here Sebastian Schmeier has created its own collection of courses covering computation/biology/bioinformatics in general. Inside the list there are links to python and bioinformatics resources but also on related topics.


Do you have other preferred courses on these topics? If so, please leave the link for them in a comment, it would be really helpful to guide my students in the future.

And also as it seems that people is interested in these kind of courses summary , maybe I could repeat this post but posting a collection of useful Machine Learning and Deep Leaning courses and/or also cheminformatics courses. In relation with python for sure. Let's see.
