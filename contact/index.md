<h1 class="page-header text-center"> Contact </h1>

The easiest way to get in touch with me is by [email]('mailto:sanchezmartinezmelchor@gmail.com).

You can also find me online at [twitter](http://twitter.com/melsanm), [linkedin](http://https://www.linkedin.com/in/melchorsanchezmartinez/), and [github](http://github.com/MelchorSanchez).

Also you can just drop me a message

<div id="contact">
        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
        <div id="contact-form">
                <form action="https://formspree.io/xqkwag" method="POST">
                <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Contact request from personal website" />
                <input type="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your email" required>
                <textarea name="message" placeholder="Type your message" required></textarea>
                <button type="submit">Send</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    </div>

I would be happy to discuss anything related to my research, the topics covered in the blog or something with that I am experienced. I would be also happy to share anything from my research that can be make public and is not available on public sources.  If I can help you, just tell me!
